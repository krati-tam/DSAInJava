Two Pointers Algorithm- 




1.1 there is two pointers one at the  beginning and other one at the end
1.2 so start traversing the array since beginning 

if (sum == target)
then return the index 
nums[i] + nums[j] == target 
return [i,j]

else 
if(sum<target)
i++
else 
sum>target
 j--


Given - [1,4,2,6,9]
target = 3
o/p= [0, 2]
